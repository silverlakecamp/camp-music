{soc: Verse 1}
[C]   I've carried a b[Dm7]urden
[Am7]   For too long on m[F2]y own
[C]   I wasn't cre[Dm7]ated
[Am7]   To bear it al[F2]one
[C]   I hear Your invi[Dm7]tation
[Am7]   To let it all g[F2]o
   I see it n[C]ow

I run to the [C]Father I fall into g[Dm7]race
I'm done with the h[Am7]iding No reason to w[F2]ait

[Am7]   The price for my[F2] heart
[C]   I don't have a [Dm7]context
[Am7]   For that kind of [F2]love
   I don't under[C]stand

   All I know [Am7]is  I [G(4)]need [F2]You

My heart has been [Am7]in Your [F2]sights
Long before [C/E]my first b[G]reath
Running in[Am7]to Your [F2]arms
Is running to [C/E]life from [G]death
I feel this [Am7]rush deep in my [F2]chest
Your mercy is [C/E]calling [G]out
Just as I [Am7]am You pull me [F2]in
I know I [C/E]need You [G]now
