O Lord my [C]God, When I in [F]awesome wonder

Thy power through[Am7]out the [G]universe dis[C]played

And when I [C]think, that God, His [F]Son not sparing
Sent Him to [Am7]die, I [G]scarce can take it [C]in
That on the [C]Cross, my burden g[F]ladly bearing
He bled and [Am7]died to [G]take away my [C]sin

When Christ shall [C]come, with shout of [F]acclamation
And take me [Am7]home, what [G]joy shall fill my [C]heart
Then I shall [C]bow, in humble [F]adoration
And then pro[Am7]claim My [G]God, how great Thou [F]art
